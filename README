A simple flip clock inspired by http://cnanney.com/journal/code/apple-style-counter-revisited/

Scripts exist to create all the image resources, so you can replace/resize the existing ones to fit your needs.

Sample usage:
cd scripts
(edit create.sh ...)
./create.sh
./copy.sh ../android/flipclock/res
(delete any resource files you dont want)

The android app contains a sample activity showing how to use the clock.
